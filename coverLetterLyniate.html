<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my interest in the advertised Junior Test Engineer role at Lyniate. As a future-orientated Software Tester with a strong foundation of technical knowledge and expertise, having experience in working with Angular, Java Spring professionally, and React and C# in my academic career. I aim to contribute to Lyniate while learning from their extensive expertise. Some prior/current experiences that prepare me well for success in this role at Lyniate are:</p>
<p>- <strong>Current employment.</strong>&nbsp;Started my current position in August 2020 as a software tester at Kiwa Digital working on 2 main products VoiceQ Native applications and VoiceQ Cloud both are post-production dubbing solutions. Gained 5 months of testing experience, where I acquired knowledge about the post-production systems while attaining exceptional communication skills interacting with various clients that are crucial for successful product development. During this period, my passion for Quality Assurance increased as I was responsible for maintaining the robustness of our products. Our developers had ended their contracts and I was trained only to maintain the codebase. Over the last 5 months, I got delegated the project to work solely on the codebase, which I saw as an opportunity to upskill myself in Angular and Java Spring, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Docker. Which further increased my passion for software development. Since then, I have implemented many changes to the codebase and have resolved many critical customer issues.</p>
<p>- <strong>Degree and majors.&nbsp;</strong>My degree of bachelor&rsquo;s in computer and Information Sciences with my majors in Software Development and Computational Intelligence aligns with the qualifications the firm is seeking for this role at Lyniate.</p>
<p>- <strong>Previous employment.&nbsp;</strong>Worked as a part-time ICT Support Technician at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) gave me a wider exposure to different types of support systems and ITIL Incidents Management. I was tasked with diagnosing and effectively resolving any hardware or software faults whilst maximizing staff/student satisfaction, in a very high-paced environment.</p>
<p>For my final year academic project, my team and I have developed a web application as a decision support system (as a KPI). This enabled Deloitte management to make more complex decisions by giving them insights into different types of performance metrics.</p>
<p>Over the summer of 2019-2020, I worked as a software tester at Kiwa Digital, helping with the development of newer versions of our post-production software (also the place of current employment).</p>
<p>I am a well-organized Developer with ability to learn quickly and have an appreciation for the importance of project planning in product development cycles and Quality Control. Including the dynamic requirements of some projects. Being outcome-driven, in my free time, I upskill in technologies which will make me competent in software development.</p>
<p>Lyniate&rsquo;s values speak highly of their work culture and align particularly well with my values. I have heard highly of development opportunities at the firm. It would be a huge honour to be working at Lyniate. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bilal Siddique</p>
